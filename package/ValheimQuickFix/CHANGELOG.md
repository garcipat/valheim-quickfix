## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Stack on tombstone pickup: after taking everything from your tombstone, partial stacks of the same item in your
  inventory are merged instead of taking two slots. Configurable via `StackOnTombstonePickup`.
- Restore tombstone slots: taking everything from a tombstone puts each item back in its original slot, moving whatever
  you picked up there since to a free slot. Configurable via `RestoreTombstoneSlots`.

### Added

- Restore shield: switching from a bow or two-handed weapon back to a one-handed weapon
  re-equips the shield that was dropped. Configurable via `RestoreShield`.
- Push boat: `[E] Push boat` interaction when standing next to a boat, to push it away from you.
  Not available while swimming or standing on the boat. Configurable via `PushBoat`.
